# Siebel-Codes
Here I keep all the codes I developed to deal with Siebel.
The one with Java Script is an inbount webservice.
In addition, python code was developed in order to assist the guys in Data Migration process. They will add a transaction for each member and based on configurations in Siebel Loyalty, they do different things.
